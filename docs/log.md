## User Story 🔗 Development Tasks

* As a student I want to add tasks with dueDates(such as assignments and
studying for exams) so the system can generate my workload. <p><t>Construct a submission tool and link to backend</t></p>
* As a student I want to add recurring events such as classes, labs, tutorials,
shifts, or extracurricular activities. <p><t>Construct a submission tool and link to backend</t></p>
* As a student I want the app to automatically generate a realistic weekly
schedule by time-blocking my tasks into my available free time, so I don’t
have to manually plan everything. <p><t>Construct a submission tool and link to backend</t></p>
* As a student I want to edit existing tasks/events (dueDate, duration, priority,
availability) and have the schedule automatically update and re-balance, so
my plan stays realistic when things change. <p><t>Construct a submission tool and link to backend</t></p>
* As a student I want the system to detect when my workload cannot fit into my
available time before dueDates and clearly warn me. <p><t>Construct a submission tool and link to backend</t></p>
